## Using a Cloud Service

Instead of installing Ruby on Rails and an editor on your computer, you can use a webservice for development. All you need is a browser and an internet connection. This guide explains how to get started with [codenvy.io](https://codenvy.io). If you're using a different service, they may use a different wording, but the process is usually pretty similar.

### *1.* Update your browser

If you use Internet Explorer, we recommend installing [Firefox](mozilla.org/firefox) or [Google Chrome](google.com/chrome).

Open [whatbrowser.org](http://whatbrowser.org) and update your browser if you don't have the latest version.

### *2.* Create an account

Go to [codenvy.io](https://codenvy.io) and signup for free.

![create account]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/codenvy/create-account.jpg)

### *3.* Setup a workspace for Ruby on Rails

The Ruby on Rails Workspace has all the software we need for the workshop already preinstalled. To create a workspace, log into [codenvy.io](https://codenvy.io) and click on 'Dashboard'. If no workspace has been created yet, the 'New Workspace' view is displayed.

![dashboard create workspace]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/codenvy/create-workspace-dashboard.jpg)

In the 'New Workspace' view, a few settings have to be made.

* 'New from blank, template, or sample project' should already be selected
* Select 'Create new workspace from stack'
* Select 'Ready to go Stacks'
* Select 'Rails' Stack
* Give the workspace a name of your choice. In the example this is 'railsgirls'.
* Now click on 'Create' to create the workspace (it takes a moment for the process to finish)

![create workspace]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/codenvy/create-workspace.jpg)

* Codeenvy creates a folder '/projects' during initialization, in which you can later put your code. It also creates a folder 'console-ruby-simple' that we do not need. You can see it in the Project Explorer. Ignore it or delete it by right-clicking on the folder.

### *4.* Find and restart your workspace
* If you've just created your project, you can probably skip these steps - they're good to know if you login to Codenvy again later
* If you haven't used your workspace or projects in a while, they might have been shutdown due to inactivity. You will notice an empty circle displayed next to the workspace name.

![start workspace]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/codenvy/start-workspace.jpg)

* In this case simply click on the name of the workspace. It will then be restarted (which can take a while) and afterwards opened.
* If you have restarted a workspace, you need to run the `bundle` command again in the directory of your Rails project (you will learn more about the command in the app tutorial)

### *5.* Coding with your project
* On the left hand side, you find a file browser where you can navigate your directories and file
* In the middle, you find the editor where you can modify your files
* At the bottom, you find the terminal where you can run commands
* Everything you need is right here in you browser window - you do not need to start an editor or terminal anywhere else
* If you are following a guide or tutorial, use the commands for Linux even if you are on a Windows computer - your operating system does not matter, since all commands are run on your project's machine in the cloud, which is running Linux
* If a guide or tutorial asks you to run a rails command that contains `rails` or `rake`, prepend `bundle exec` to this command, e. g. `bundle exec rails db:migrate`. Exception: the `rails new` command is not prefixed.
* If a guide or tutorial asks you to start the rails server with `rails server` or `rails s`, append `-b 0.0.0.0` to this command so that you run `rails server -b 0.0.0.0`
* If a guide or tutorial asks you to point your browser to something like `http://localhost:3000`, follow these instructions instead:

  * Go to ‘[Workspaces](https://codenvy.io/dashboard/#/workspaces)’ and click your running workspace
    ![workspace settings]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/codenvy/workspace-settings.jpg)

  * Click ‘Runtime’, then ‘dev-machine’ to view the details
    ![workspace runtime]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/codenvy/runtime.jpg)

  * Scroll down to 'Servers', and copy the Address entry in the line starting
    with 'server-3000-tcp'
    ![get workspace ip]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/codenvy/get-workspace-ip.jpg)

    For example, if the tutorial wants you to visit `http://localhost:3000/posts`, you would open the URL `http://node3.codenvy.io:33079/posts` instead.
